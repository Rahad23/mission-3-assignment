### How to run my server.

## 1. If you run ...**npm run start:prod**.... with this command, the server.js file stored in dist with nodemon will be run, before giving ...npm run start:prod..., convert from typescript to js ...npm run build... command,

## 2. ...**npm run dev**... command will run the server.ts file placed in src with ts-node-dev.
